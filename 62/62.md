## Solution

| Robot |  1   |  1   |  1   |     1      |
| :---: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--------: |
|   1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |     5      |
|   1   |  3   |  6   |  10  | Finish(15) |

- Robot can only move either down or right. We assign 1 on first column and row representing there is only one way to get there
- For each coordinate(i,j), the total ways  will be sum of ways from its top and ways from its left side

$$
\sum (i-1,j) + (i,j-1)
$$

- space: O($m\times n$)
- running time O($m\times n$)
