## Problem

```tex
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
```

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an *m* x *n* matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.



## Summary

- Row and colum are both sorted in ascending order. Starting from top right corner can help us reduce cases.
  - If target greater current value, we go to next row
  - otherwisem go to next column
